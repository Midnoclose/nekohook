## About
Nekohook is a cheat library designed to be baked into your own cheat to give it the features it needs.
Current builds are poc for dev use only, use [commit 3b185ea](https://github.com/oneechanhax/nekohook/commit/3b185ea50a578a3029a33aeab4e191e91a8e539c) for the last working build, which still works and hasn't broken.
Note that commits are spurratic and random in size and timing. In the future, once out of "main" development and in working state, releases will be versioned, and commits kept to one feature/change.

## Anticheat notice
Nekohook is currently VAC undetected on linux only!
Anti-cheat undetection methods are up to you and you only until a maintained open source alternative is discovered.

## Usage
Nekohook is to be built using cmake using normal cmake usage.   
The dummy library may be omitted to test for missing symbols during debug.
Tools to link to nekohook will be added later for automatic dummy application.
