## About
Nekohook is an extremely modular training software framework designed to work with many games, even games not using the source engine!   
This nekohook fork is currently a work in progress but you may request a personal build at the discord server if you cant build yourself.   

Nekohook is currently VAC undetected on linux only!

# Installation and usage
Nekohook uses game modules. You must select one to build.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/oneechanhax/nekohook && cd nekohook && ./build
```

## Updating
```bash
git pull
```

## Injecting
Use the attach script like so. You may find more useful development tools with -h.
```bash
sudo ./attach
```

## Issues
You may report issues to the github.    
Explain what the issue is and how to recreate it in detail.   
Providing a backtrace or even a fix is recommended.
