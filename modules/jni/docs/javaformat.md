For your java program to use nekohook, you will need to put everything into a specific folder.
"neko.<Your Classname Here>" is what nekohook itself will be expecting when it searches for functions to run.

Please keep the naming similear to nekohooks as well, I will try my best to make the jni module look for the names themselves
